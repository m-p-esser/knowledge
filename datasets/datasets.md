# Evaluation guide for external data sources

> Inherited data are easier to get but harder to trust.

## Primary criteria

- Purpose — was the dataset collected for a similar purpose to yours?
- Competence — do you trust the team who collected the data to take measurements in a competent fashion?
- Agenda — do you trust the dataset not to be tainted by the biases and agendas of its authors?
- Clarity — is there clear documentation to prevent you from misinterpreting the contents of the dataset?
- Processing — are you sure the dataset hasn’t been transformed, skewed, or otherwise tampered with?

## Additional questions to ask

- Is it hard to clean the data?
- Is the data current? The newer the better
- Can i combine it with existing data? Usually the case in Relation database
- Is the method of collection described? Does the methodology seem valid?
- Does the dataset contain information which i haven't seen before but which is potentially interesting?
- Is there a data dictionary to describe the contents of the data?
