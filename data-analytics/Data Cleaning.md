# Data Cleaning

Common issues in data can be
- Missing values (value for multiple observations / instances is empty)
- Inaccurate / Wrong data (value for certain observations is plain wrong, e.g. due to human error in entry - hard to spot, except you know how to look for it, person can't be 800 years old)
- Censored data (certain values are shown as range, e.g. <100)
