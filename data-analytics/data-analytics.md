# Definition Data Analytics

> Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data in order to make conclusions about that information

> Analytics is not marketing. The difference is that one is about expanding the decision-maker’s perspective while the other is about narrowing it.

> If a decision-maker doesn’t want to give up their power to choose, it’s an analyst’s duty to respect that. Even if the analyst knows the domain better than the decision-maker.

> Do not come to conclusions beyond the data (and prevent your audience from doing it, too)
