# Modes of learning

In the book "mind for numbers" thinking gets separate in two distinct classes. There is diffused and focussed thinking.

 To learn a new subject it is necessary to start in diffused mode and think in a big picture. Therefore it's necessary to gather information by research. It's crucial to know what to look for and when to stop. 

Focussed thinking is necessary when understanding a topic more in depth. The danger of focussed thinking is that you can get stuck in thinking about a topic the same way over and over again. The solution to a problem might be in a totally different area. That's why it's important to switch into diffused thinking to break out of the narrow view of focussed thinking when stuck.

Both modes are mutually exclusive. You can enter both modes simultaneously. But you can switch between both and easily switching between them is necessary to solve a problem creatively.
