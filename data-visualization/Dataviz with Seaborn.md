# Dataviz with Seaborn

- How do I convert Content of Jupyter Notebook in HTML?

Important
- Code Blocks should be configurable
- Input and/or Output, option to hide

Should I use a Jeckyl Bootstrap Template?
Are there Django Bootstrap Templates I can use? 

Maybe an ECommerce Template is a good starting point (Because there is usually a image gallery, different product categories, filter options)
